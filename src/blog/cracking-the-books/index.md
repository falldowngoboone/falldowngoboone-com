If you’re like me, you’re 6’2”, have terrible eyesight, and a weird affinity for [guitar repair videos](https://www.youtube.com/@twoodfrd). You probably also like to read.

One of my [goals this year](https://www.falldowngoboone.com/blog/year-end-review-2023/#2024-goals) is to read at least 24 books, and I’m off to a pretty good start. While I’m trying to work more fiction into my reading, I still love a good software engineering book.

So you can imagine how excited I was to come across this [gem of a video](https://youtu.be/Y2iJOPxw0JU?si=KrRy0d7yVg86HGx5) from Engineering with Utsav. Utsav has put together a small but mighty collection of software engineering books that would make any nerd happy.

I’ve added all of these books to my Notion bookshelf, and I’m looking forward to checking them out!
